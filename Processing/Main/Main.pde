 *  Pareto Optimizer facilitates the analysis and visualization of scenarios in a 
 *  multi-objective optimization problem. To use this software, you must already have 
 *  a data-set of design scenarios and their multi-objective performance. For instance:
 *
 *  Scenario Name  |  Objective #1      |  Objective #1      |  Objective #3      | ...
 *  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *  Scenario A     |  Objective #1 (A)  |  Objective #2 (A)  |  Objective #3 (A)  | ...
 *  Scenario B     |  Objective #1 (B)  |  Objective #2 (B)  |  Objective #3 (B)  | ...
 *  ...            |  ...               |  ...               |  ...               | ...
